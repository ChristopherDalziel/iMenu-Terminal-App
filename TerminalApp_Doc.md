# Terminal App - Assignment 1
### Christopher Dalziel

menu something

## Pitch 


## List of features 
1. Database menu/Display
2. Customer order input
3. Change order
4. Pay
5. Print orders for the day

##How the user will interact with your app 
User will open the app, app will display menu options and ask for an order. 
Once the user has input an order the app will confirm and ask if any changes need to be made. 
App will ask for a payment input

### Status Update 1
Hey Rachael/Harrison.

Emailing my first status update. 

My app is at point where it is doing the bare minimum of what it is supposed to be able to achieve. 
I’m able to display my menu database in the terminal, and have the user make a selection for their order, have my app inform them of a price and have the user enter a pay value. 
I also currently have a feature where at the end of my app the payment amount is outputted to a CSV file, I’m looking to expand on this to make it a profit sheet or a daily value possibly. 

My issues at the moment are struggling to create a loop to get the correct payment type. 
I feel as though my code isn’t very “DRY” but a lot of it is reliant on the users input into the terminal and I’m not too sure how dry it can be. 
Hoping to talk to one of you about that soon. 

Looking to implement another CSV for a drink menu for another feature and combine that will the final order input. 
Still need to implement a gem and look at documentation but I have made a very small start. 

Thanks, 
Christopher Dalziel
