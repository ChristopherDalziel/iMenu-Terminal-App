# Terminal App - Assignment 1
### Christopher Dalziel



## Pitch 


## List of features 
1. Database menu/Display
2. Further database display
3. Customer order input
4. Change order
5. Pay
6. Print orders for the day

## Development Plan

## How the user will interact with your app 
Open opening the app a pre-installed menu will be displayed, the user will be able to ask for further info on each intem displayed here or chose to move on without it. The app will them ask the user to place an order of an item displayed off the menu. In the future the menu will be adjusted to include multiple's of the same items, and further items/extra menu's (Drinks, Deserts etc.). 
Once the user has has chosen their item(s) the system will congradulate, repeat their order and ask for a payment input. If the user puts in the correct amount the app will return change or return their input to them if it's below the required, an amount equal to the required will proceed. 
Once the order is completed the order will be exported to a seperate csv file for records, which at a later date can be improved to track profits, order numbers, etc. Then the app will ask if there is another customer/order and repeat or end.

### Status Update 1
Hey Rachael/Harrison.

Emailing my first status update. 

My app is at point where it is doing the bare minimum of what it is supposed to be able to achieve. 
I’m able to display my menu database in the terminal, and have the user make a selection for their order, have my app inform them of a price and have the user enter a pay value. 
I also currently have a feature where at the end of my app the payment amount is outputted to a CSV file, I’m looking to expand on this to make it a profit sheet or a daily value possibly. 

My issues at the moment are struggling to create a loop to get the correct payment type. 
I feel as though my code isn’t very “DRY” but a lot of it is reliant on the users input into the terminal and I’m not too sure how dry it can be. 
Hoping to talk to one of you about that soon. 

Looking to implement another CSV for a drink menu for another feature and combine that will the final order input. 
Still need to implement a gem and look at documentation but I have made a very small start. 

Thanks, 
Christopher Dalziel
